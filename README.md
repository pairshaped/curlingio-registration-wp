# Curling I/O Registration Shortcodes

Adds shortcodes to display your Curling I/O leagues, competitions, and products. Valid sections are: "leagues", "competitions", and "products". You need to pass your Curling I/O subdomain.

So if you Curling I/O instance is demo.curling.io then to display your leagues, the shortcode would be `[curlingio section=leagues subdomain=demo]`
